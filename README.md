## Introduction
* The LMOD dataset is the first satellite video multi-object detection dataset with both **large-scale and multiclass labeling features**. LMOD consists of eight sequences from seven videos.  
- LOMD has a wide range of annotation, the smallest image width is **1500×1160**, and the largest image width is **4000×2000**. The large range of scenes can better simulate the effect of object detection methods used in real scenes, but at the same time, it brings more challenges for object detection.

* The LMOD is labeled with **459,713 vehicle objects**, **9,390 aircraft objects**, **10,536 ship objects** and **693 train objects**, for a total of **480,332 objects**, with each sequence labeled with **at least two classes of objects**.
